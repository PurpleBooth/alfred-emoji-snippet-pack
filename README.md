# A snippet pack for alfred

![screenshot showing it imported](screenshot.png)

Inspired by
[califa/alfred-emoji-pack](https://github.com/califa/alfred-emoji-pack),

Couple of things that are different though:

  - Fully automated releases - As soon as the place we get our Emoji's
    from updates, a new version will be built
  - Less repeating emoji
  - More descriptive names

Mostly these are just personal taste and the original project was a
great inspiration.
