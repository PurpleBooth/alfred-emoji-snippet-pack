# A snippet pack for alfred 🎩

![screenshot showing it imported](screenshot.png)

Inspired by
[califa/alfred-emoji-pack](https://github.com/califa/alfred-emoji-pack),
which is worth a look. 👀

Couple of things that are different though:

-   🚀 Fully automated releases - As soon as [the place we get our
    Emoji's from](https://github.com/github/gemoji) updates, a new
    version will be built and released ✨automagically✨
-   🏳️‍⚧️ Contains Emoji 13.1 emojis
-   🔁 No repeating emoji
-   🗯️ More descriptive names
-   ⁉️ Prefix and suffix is done with configuration meaning it's easy to
    change in Alfred
-   👏🏿 Has skin tones (👏 then choose the skin tone 🏿)

Mostly these are just personal taste and the original project was a
great inspiration.

## Installing

Download the [latest
release](https://github.com/PurpleBooth/alfred-emoji-snippet-pack/releases/latest)
